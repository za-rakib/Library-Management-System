# Library management 

A full-stack Library Management web app. The project “Library Management System” is developed in React and Node.js, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding books, updating information, searching for books and members and returning books.
 Admin is the one who administers the system by adding or removing books. Admin can add books to the system by entering the details of the books and can even update the details. Students have to register themselves into the system to create an account. The students can issue books and simultaneously the number of issue books will be decremented.
